## Twit Feed ##

Take a Twitter timeline from a user or a list and return the best links, as ranked by the number of retweets. Since the search API doesn't offer RT counts at the moment, we aren't able to do the same for hashtags or searches.

#### TODO ####
*  Clean up error pages for when twitter data is bad or missing
*  Add general 404 and 500 pages
*  Add page caching
*  Create unified js function for ajax calls
